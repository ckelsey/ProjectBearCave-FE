Although we go to great lengths to make sure our information is accurate and useful, we recommend you consult a lawyer if you want professional assurance that our information, and your interpretation of it, is appropriate to your particular situation. You should consider all postings or writings at ClassActionInc.com by staff or others as personal opinion only and NOT the advice of a lawyer.</p>
